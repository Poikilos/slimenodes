Make bouncy solid slime and non-flowing liquid slime in minetest!

## Changes in expertmm fork
* added physics
  * solid is bouncy
  * all bouncy slime nodes stop fall damage (-100%; not sure how with liquid slime)
  * liquid is liquid-like
* made buckets for all types so collectors are not needed and storage is nerfed by 1 per inventory slot
* made recipes for all types (only if you have meseconds installed, since uses glue)
* made all liquid blocks behave like each other and all solid blocks behave like each other (though levels differ)
* changed sounds so liquid and solid each use a different one of the dug sounds, but this doesn't seem to work unless using slime collectors


## Known Issues
~=low-priority
* (~) slime collectors are still not craftable (may be left that way since multiplayer could use some limitation on storage--see above)
